QR Code-Based Contact Tracing for Communities

[Demo](https://demo.trackcovid.net/)

This is an open source project which is provided freely to communities which are interested in setting up digital contact tracing to supplement manual contact tracing in a way that is both easy to use and preserves privacy.

Here I present a plan for setting up QR code-based contact tracing in your community or jurisdiction, with all of the source code necessary for this to happen. This approach can potentially add an additional layer of protection as public places begin reopening. Manual contact tracing in public places is very difficult, if not impossible in many cases. Our approach can help to notify people of potential exposure at these public places in a way that does not invade their privacy.

If you are interested, I am happy to collaborate as needed to make this a reality in your community. I'm not looking for anything in return other than to see privacy-preserving digital contact be implemented.
